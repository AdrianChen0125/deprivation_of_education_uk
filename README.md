# Deprivation_of_education_uk
Education deprivation is a multifaceted problem encompassing insufficient infrastructure, economic barriers, and geographic isolation. Policy makers need to perceive level of deprivation in education to implement appropriate policies to ameliorate this discrepancy.
Objectives: 
1. Perform K-means clustering and PCA at the local authority level to evaluate the association among educational deprivation scores and other variables, including income, employment, health, crime, environment,and the population of dependent children.
2. Predict educational deprivation scores using the multi-linear regression model and compare different variables selected by the correlation matrix and PCA.
